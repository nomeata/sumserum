### About Sum Serum

Sum Serum is an independent and unauthorized browser implementation of
the very nice board game [**Sim
Serim**](http://www.spiel-und-design.eu/index.php?seite=shop&kategorie=tabuluna&gruppe=1&Nr=0040)
by Heinrich Glumpler. You can find [English
rules](http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/39765/sim-serim-english-rules)
on [BoardGameGeek](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30046/sim-serim).

This implementation lets you play locally, with two player on one
machine (make sure you do not let your opponent see what button you
press), or via the internet. In that case, just press “Play online” and
wait for someone else to join (or better arrange for someone else to
join).

Sum Serum was implemented by [Joachim
Breitner](http://www.joachim-breitner.de/) and is Free Software. Feel
free to look [at the code](http://git.nomeata.de/?p=sumserum.git) or
[report a problem or a
pull-request](https://github.com/nomeata/sumserum/issues). It builds on
HTML5, Canvas, node.js and SockJS and is currently hosted by
[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/).
